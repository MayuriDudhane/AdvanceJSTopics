### Introduction

Manipulating the DOM, or the "Document Object Model", is a key aspect of web development. According to [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model/Introduction), "The Document Object Model (DOM) is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web." The challenges around DOM manipulation on the web have often been the impetus behind using JavaScript frameworks instead of vanilla JavaScript to manage the DOM, but we will manage on our own!

Think of the DOM as a tree, representing all the ways that a web page document can be manipulated. Various APIs (Application Program Interfaces) have been written so that programmers, using their programming language of choice, can access the DOM and edit, change, rearrange, and otherwise manage it.
